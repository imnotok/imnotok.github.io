<p>Chaplin has support for guest posts. That means that if you were to have another blogger write on your blog, just edit the <code class="highlighter-rouge">YAML</code> front matter like so:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="s">author</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Guest Name</span>
<span class="s">profile_picture</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Source for the Picture</span>
<span class="s">author_site</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Author's Presence online</span>
<span class="s">author_stub</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Your Short Bio</span></code></pre></figure>
